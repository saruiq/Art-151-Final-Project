    <p> The basis of my work is that I wanted to represent a concept where things may not seem the way you think things are. In my artwork, this is portrayed by the gold frame in the middle of the canvas. At the first glance, the scenery looks like a bright morning, but when you press the keys, then you can see through the gold frame that there is a lot of thunder and lightning. I also added some tints to the background where you can match the color of the thunder and kind of shows what the weather really looks like from our perception. I got my inspiration from researching nature pictures and seeing the beauty behind it. I also feel in a way that thunder sounds can be relaxing at times. I also was really inspired in mixing the modern and traditional styles together, to create an abstract effect. </p>
